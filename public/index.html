        <p><h3>This project is designed to be a quick, repeatable process that allows those of us who do not have a hand dexterity issue to understand what it is like to have an experience of this type of disability.</h3></p>

        <h2 class = "setup_experiment" style="color: rgb(110, 12, 221);">WHY should I do it?
        </h2>
        <p><h3>Disability is something that will affect all of our lives. When we reach the later years of our journey we will be more challenged in every aspect of our PHYSICAL SELVES. We will be disabled! Learning about some of these issues today can help us to make better decisions on how we create the world of tomorrow including products, places and experiences. This could lead to longer periods of our lives being lived independently. Knowing about the experience of disability today helps us to understand our FUTURE SELVES! </h3></p>
        <h2 class = "setup_experiment" style="color: rgb(110, 12, 221);">But PENCILS???
        </h2>
        <p><h3>The experiment is based around using pencils or pens to disable yourself and to be able to have a glimpse into the experience of having a dexterity problem. By using pencils or pens in the way described in this experiment the person experiencing the project can use items that are right in front of them.</h3></p>
        <h2 class = "setup_experiment" style="color: rgb(110, 12, 221);">RepeatABILITY, what does that mean?
        </h2>
        <p><h3>The fact that pens or pencils are used means that the experience can be repeated easily and at will with little or no effort thereby increasing the exposure of the individual to the problems with this kind of disability and increasing awareness. </h3></p>
